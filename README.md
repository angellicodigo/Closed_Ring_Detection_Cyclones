Medicanes are special kind of cyclones that appear only in the Mediterranean Sea. One of their properties described by The Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (CNR-ISAC) is having a strong near-surface wind field with closed cyclonic structure. This project aims to use machine learning to detect these closed ring of maximum wind of cyclones, including Medicanes. We are using Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) winds data at 12.5 km resolution.

This project is exploring the use of object detection (Faster R-CNN) and semantic segmentaiton (U-Nets) models. The state of the project now is currently trying to use U-Nets, specifically with partial convolution, to detect these closed ring of maximum wind speeds. This project is a W.I.P. The dataset is not uploaded on the repository to save storage.
